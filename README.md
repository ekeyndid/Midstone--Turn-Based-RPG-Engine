# Midstone--Turn-Based-RPG-Engine

Current list of ideas:

Accuracy and different attacks that use that accuracy (So strikes miss more(Could be done by extending critical and miss ranges)) d6, d10, d100? https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Random.Range.html 

“Critical” Hits

Active Time Battle

Revive Items

HP/MP system

UI for battle [Attack] [Spell] [Item/Other] 

Element Triangle (rock-paper-scissors system)

Enemy stats (Defense, Evasion etc. (decreases damage, increases miss range etc.)) 

Item system

Overworld, with items in some spots( like in pokemon or ff6 lol) (?)

All sprite based stuff including overworld sprites

Each equipped weapons has different stats

Enemies can carry items they can use in battle

Enemy Drops
